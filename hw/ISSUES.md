* Poor hall sensor performance for high power. use shunt-based current sensor
* poor WiFi at 800W, move antenna away from coil?
* ESP32: does it support frequency >= 50 kHz with enough precision (11-bit)? the ledc API appears not
* place input filter caps closer to ADC
* Use Terminals for wires (square)
* use 2 HS fets?
